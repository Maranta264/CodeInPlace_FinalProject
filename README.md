# 'What to have for dinner?' - Code in Place 2024 Final Project

This is my first Python project, created as my final project for Code In Place - an online course by Stanford University. 

I've made use of the key concepts taught by the course, including loops, lists, and dictionaries, and carried out further reading to achieve the outcome I was pursuing with this program. 

## Description
The purpose of this program is to help me decide what to have for dinner! I often spend far too long unable to make my mind up, either what to cook, or what takeaway to get. This program will solve this problem! 

### How the program works
Alongside the program file are two CSV files - one containing a list of takeaway options, and the other with a list of recipes and their ingredients. Depending on the input entered by the user, the program will present various options:
* a suggeted takeaway option
* a suggested recipe containing an ingredient input by the user
* a list of all recipes containing an ingredient input by the user

The user can then opt to see a list of all ingredients for the suggested recipe, or a chosen recipe from the list.
